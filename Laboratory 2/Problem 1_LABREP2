# A group of statisticians at a local college has asked you to create a set of functions that compute the median and mode of a set of numbers, as defined in the below sample programs: 

# -mode.py 
# -median.py

# Define these functions in a module named stats.py. Also include a function named mean, which computes the average of a set of numbers. 
# Each function should expect a list of numbers as an argument and return a single number. 
# Each function should return 0 if the list is empty. 
# Include a main function that tests the three statistical functions with a given list.

MMM = input('Find the mean, mode or median. Type EXIT to stop: ') #Guevarra
while MMM != "EXIT":
    if MMM == "mode":
        print("Finding mode...")
        import mode
    elif MMM == "median":
        print("Finding median...")
        import median
    elif MMM == "mean":
        print("Finding mean...")
        import mean
    MMM = input('Find the mean, mode or median. Type EXIT to stop: ')
