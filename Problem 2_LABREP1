# Write a program that allows the user to navigate through the lines of text in a file. 
# The program prompts the user for a filename and inputs the lines of text into a list. 
# The program then enters a loop in which it prints the number of lines in the file and prompts the user for a line number. 
# Actual line numbers range from 1 to the number of lines in the file. 
# If the input is 0, the program quits. Otherwise, the program prints the line associated with that number.
